## About the Author

I am Francis Avila, a software developer for web-facing software since 2008.
Since 2013 I've worked primarily in [Clojure], [ClojureScript] and [Datomic]
(on-prem, not cloud).
I even co-authored a [Clojure book][clojure-in-action] back in 2015.

This site is a vehicle for me to share my technical knowledge and opinions.

Since 2019 I've been a backend engineer at [Shortcut],
which has a very large and long-running Datomic database.

## About this site's name

This site's title references two intellectual virtues from Aristotle's
[Nichomachean Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicomachean_Ethics).

_Phronesis_ (_φρόνησῐς_) is the power to decide how to act in particular
situations with respect to the overall goods and goals involved in living well.
It is usually translated as "prudence".

_Techne_ (_τέχνη_) is the power of knowing contingent causes
oriented towards producing a practical effect.
It is usually translated as "art" or "craft",
and is the virtue one exercises when practicing engineering
or any activity where the goal is making something.

Putting these together, _Phronesis in Techne_ is roughly "prudence in crafting."
This site is where I write about technical matters that involve weighing
tradeoffs, or just lessons I have learned from experience.
